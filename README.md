## Usage

### User Journey

1. **Registration**
   - Users register their phone numbers via SMS or USSD.
   - The system verifies the phone number and creates a user profile on the blockchain.

2. **Accessing Services**
   - Users can access various blockchain services by sending specific SMS or USSD codes.
   - The backend processes these requests and interacts with the blockchain to execute the required transactions.

3. **Transaction Confirmation**
   - Users receive confirmation messages for their transactions via SMS.
   - The system ensures that all transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain.

### Using USSD

1. **Dial USSD Code**
   - Users dial a specific USSD code to access the service menu.
   - Example: `*123#`

2. **Enter PIN or Register**
   - If the number is already registered, users enter their PIN.
   - If the number is not registered, users are prompted to register.
   - Example: `1. Enter PIN` or `2. Register`

3. **USSD Menu Options**
   - After entering the PIN or registering, users can access the following options:
     1. **Check Balance**
        - Example: `1. Check Balance`
     2. **Pay for Services**
        - Example: `2. Pay for Services`
     3. **Change PIN**
        - Example: `3. Change PIN`
     4. **Transaction History**
        - Example: `4. Transaction History`
     5. **Help**
        - Example: `5. Help`

4. **Receive Confirmation**
   - The system displays a confirmation message on the user's phone screen.

### Using SMS

1. **Send a Registration SMS**
   - Users send a registration SMS to a designated number.
   - Example: `REGISTER <YourName>`

2. **Receive Confirmation**
   - The system sends a confirmation SMS with a unique user ID.

3. **Access Services**
   - Users send specific codes to access services.
   - Example: `BALANCE` to check account balance.
   - Example: `PAY <ServiceCode> <Amount>` to pay for services.
   - Example: `HISTORY` to view transaction history.
   - Example: `HELP` to get help.
